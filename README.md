Note: this project is a fork, and I will continue to develope this where the Namkatz (the previous owner) left off.

Welcome to Pinbox Ultimatr! Pinbox Ultimate is a fork of namkatz's homebrew application for the Nintendo 3DS that streams content from your Windows PC to the 3DS. Keep in mind, Pinbox is currenty in alpha, so bugs will occur! Contact Ccreng for (not too much) help. 

# Current Support
- Streaming from Windows PC to a 3DS ( or over internet from VPS windows server )
- Audio support (MP2 encode/decode)
- Hardware acceleration Y2R
- Emulation Xbox 360 Controller for awesome game support ( by ViGEm )
- Support for Keyboard mapping with profile select from 3DS side
- Realtime config from 3DS side

#### Plans
- fix it so it is more versatile for different screen resoulutions.
-  Implement Qt UI for basic use
-  add Hub UI for fast access to game or app
 - Checker for wifi and sleepmode and other events relating to 3DS
# Requirements to get Pinbox to run:
* Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015
https://goo.gl/ijdZ1x
- Xbox 360 Accessories Software 1.2 (contains the missing device drivers)
https://goo.gl/xPK8qE

- Make sure Windows is up to date with the latest security patches and updates
- Install the Virtual Game pad Emulation Framework
https://goo.gl/qcuVbp
- Keep in mind: The requirements to Pinbox may change, this will get updated, so keep patient.

#### Notes
- Enable firewall to allow port 1234 in and out (or disable the firewall when using the software and enable the firewall when done)
- Make sure both devices are connected to Wifi
- You do not have to type in port 1234, this will crash the app
- If you are getting a black screen in Pinbox, open server.cfg in the Pinbox server directory and change monitor index to zero
# Installation
- I will make a tutorial on gbatemp, and an updated youtube video, explaining how to use it.

# Troubleshooting

Ask for help, but I can't have too many people asking questions at once, i am planning on making my own discord channel for this pinbox.
